## What is BIPOC

_BIPOC_ is short for **Black, Indigenous && People of Color**

## What is a Developer Advocate

That's an excellent question here are some definitions around the web.

> "The main task of developer relations is to build relationships with users and potential users, mediate between them and the company, and advo- cate for their best interest." - [_Sam Julien_ ](https://learn.samjulien.com/getting-started-in-developer-relations)

> "Developer advocacy focuses on championing the developer users and representing their interests and input both externally and internally." - [Kim Maida](https://dev.to/kimmaida/the-developer-relations-explainer-431o)

> "I like to say that it’s my job to ask dumb questions so you don’t have to, but the real goal of a Developer Advocate is to become the voice of the user... It’s our job to make sure the needs of the developer are kept in mind.." - [Ashley McNamara](https://medium.com/@ashleymcnamara/what-is-developer-advocacy-3a92442b627c)
## What's the plan for this information?

I would like to showcase content from these individuals to help bring awareness of DevRel to BIPOC communities
